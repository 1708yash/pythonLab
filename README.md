## Introduction

This repository demonstrates multiple optimization techniques implemented in Python. The primary focus is on:
- Optimization with **Lagrange Multipliers**.
- Optimization with both **equality and inequality constraints**.
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** for multidimensional functions.
- **Numerical Integration** and **Differentiation** techniques.

Each experiment in the repository contains Python code that showcases a specific optimization problem and provides a hands-on learning approach.

## Installation

Make sure you have **Python 3.11** or later installed. The following packages are required:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `pyswarm` (for PSO)

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pyswarm
